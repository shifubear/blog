    "> \n",
    "> 1. $[\\cdot, \\cdot]$ is bilinear. This simply means that the function is linear in each of its inputs.\n",
    "> 2. $[\\cdot, \\cdot]$ is skew symmetric: $[X, Y] = -[Y, X]$ for all $X, Y \\in \\frak{g}$. \n",

    "The bilinearity and skew symmetry are easy to show for this map. The Jacobi identity can also easily be verified with a few minutes of expanding the brackets and verifying the result is zero. Apparently in a later chapter it will be shown that every Lie algebra $\\frak{g}$ can be embedded into an associative algebra $A$ in such a way that the bracket becomes $XY - YX$ in what is called the Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem. This is neat because the definition of the bracket is quite abstract, but this mapping allows us to work with it in a more concrete way. \n",

    "\n",
    "By the statement above, it suffices to show that the base algebra is associative, and that $XY - YX \\in \\frak{g}$ for all $X, Y \\in \\frak{g}$ to prove this is a Lie algebra. The space of all $n \\times n$ matrices is associative. To see that $XY - YX \\in \\frak{sl}(n;\\mathbb{C})$, \n",

The set containing the zero matrix $\\{0\\}$ is trivially an ideal, since there is no way to multiply a matrix and get something else. What remains is to show that any ideal $\\frak h$ containing a non-zero element is actually equal to $\\frak{sl}(n;\\mathbb{C})$. \n",

    "Suppose first that $b \\neq 0$. We first show that $A \\in \\frak h$. Since $\\frak h$ is an ideal with element $H$, this implies that $[A, H] \\in \\frak h$. By the same argument, we also know that $[A, [A, H]] \\in \\frak h$. Let's see what this element is: \n",
