    "$(\\Rightarrow)$ Suppose that $g$ and $g'$ commute. Since both are elements of the Pauli group, this means that in each index we have either 1) a non-identity Pauli on one generator and identity on the other or 2) the same Pauli on each position. If both generators are built with identities and the same Pauli, they trivially commute and it is not necessary to test. Another possibility is that the total number of indices with non-commuting terms is even, since in a non-commuting index the commutator picks up a phase of -1. To determine this, we represent $g = (x_1, \\ldots, x_n, z_1, \\ldots, z_n)$ and $g' = (x_1', \\ldots, x_n', z_1', \\ldots, z_n')$, where we have used a length $2n$ bit vector to represent indices of the generator that have (or don't have) an $X$ component with 1 (or 0), and the same in the second half of the matrix for $Z$. For $Y$ we simply set the corresponding index for both terms to 1. Now if the two generators commute, then we should have \n",

    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_iz_i' + z_ix_i') = 0,$$\n",

    "$(\\Leftarrow)$ Suppose that for $g, g' \\in S$, we have $r(g)\\Lambda r(g')^T = 0$. This implies that the total number of non-commuting indices of $g$ and $g'$ is even. This implies $g$ and $g'$ commute since each non-commuting index contributes a phase of -1 when taking the commutator, which when taken to an even power gives 1. \n",
