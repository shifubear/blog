    "# Hall LGLAR Chapter 2: The Matrix Exponential\n",
    "\n",
    "From what I know, the matrix exponential is an important operation used to connect Lie groups and Lie algebras. This chapter introduces the matrix exponential and explores properties about it that should lead to insights on the nature of this connection. \n",

    "## The Exponential of a Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Before introducing the exponential of a matrix, we begin by defining the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of a matrix. There are multiple norms that can be defined on the space of matrices, but this seems to be the choice for the study of Lie algebras. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 1**: For any matrix $X \\in M_n(\\mathbb{C})$, we define \n",
    "\n",
    "$$||X|| = \\left( \\sum_{j,k=1}^n |X_{j,k}|^2\\right)^{1/2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantity $||X||$ is called the **Hilbert-Schmidt norm** of $X$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This definition is basically the definition of a norm of a vector, where we take the standard vector norm after flattening the matrix $X$, making it quite easy to memorize. A really neat property of the Hilbert-Schmidt norm is that it is independent of the basis, and can be computed by the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$||X|| = \\left(\\text{tr} (X^*X)\\right)^{1/2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This alternative characterization for the Hilbert-Schmidt norm was somewhat confusing for me at first, but I found a nice way for me to visualize the quantity that the norm is capturing. If you recall, the standard inner product $\\left< \\cdot, \\cdot \\right>$ between vectors $x, y \\in \\mathbb{C}^n$ has the following property when combined with an $n \\times n$ matrix $A$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left<x, Ay\\right> = \\left< A^* x, y \\right>.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we ask how much the inner product between two unit vectors $\\left< x, y\\right>$ changes after transforming them by a matrix $A$, we get the following expression: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left<Ax, Ay\\right> = \\left<A^*Ax, y\\right>.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous blog post, I explored the trace in an effort to find a geometric interpretation for it. One definition I found was that the trace of an operator characterizes how much an operator scales the volume of a unit ball. Under this picture, the average difference between $\\left< x, y\\right>$ and $\\left<Ax, Ay\\right>$, with the two unit vectors $x, y$ sampled uniformly, is upper-bounded by an expression involving the trace of $A^*A$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_x \\int_y \\left<x,y\\right> - \\left<Ax, Ay\\right> dx dy = \\int \\int \\left<x,y\\right> - \\left<A^*Ax, y\\right> dx dy = \\int \\int \\left<x,y\\right> - \\text{tr}(A^*A)/n dx dy \\leq 1 - \\text{tr}(A^*A)/n $$\n",

    "2. $||XY|| \\leq ||X||\\; ||Y||$\n",

    "We also take a quick trip back to calculus class to refresh on the definition of a matrix exponential. \n",
